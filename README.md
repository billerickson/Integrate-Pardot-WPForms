Send your form data from WPForms to Pardot

## Description

"Integrate Pardot and WPForms" easily connects forms on your website to Pardot using [Form Handlers](https://www.pardot.com/training/form-handlers-15-introduction-to-form-handlers/), enabling you to capture more leads and manage campaigns more effectively.

[WPForms](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=402581&b=834775&m=64312&afftrack=pardot%2Dplugin&urllink=)' simple drag-and-drop form builder allows you to create new forms with ease and its clean, modern code makes customizations a snap. This integration also works with the free version, [WPForms Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/), but I highly recommend purchasing the full WPForms for the valuable premium features and support.

## Installation

1. Install this plugin, along with [WPForms](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=402581&b=834775&m=64312&afftrack=pardot%2Dplugin&urllink=) (or [WPForms Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/)).
2. In the WordPress Dashboard, go to WPForms > Add New and create a form. You can add whatever fields you like, but at a minimum you must include an Email and Name field.
3. Click “Settings” in the left column, then select “Pardot”. Type in the Form Handler URL.
4. Log into Pardot and map the form fields to Pardot fields. For more information, see Pardot's [Introduction to Form Handlers](https://www.pardot.com/training/form-handlers-15-introduction-to-form-handlers/)
